# Data-Structures-Fundamentals-with-Java
The Data Structures course introduces participants to the most used data structures in programming by laying a solid foundation, lots of hands-on work, and useful theory.
I will learn about the implementation of lists, queues, stacks, trees, and some algorithms such as recursive depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
I will learn not only to work with ready-made programming libraries, but also to implement your own structures. You will gain knowledge on how to decide when and which
data structure to use by analyzing the complexity of the algorithms for each operation.
The course starts tomorrow (7th of November). Wish me a luck :)
